Contact form with captcha plugin allows you to use a Google reCAPTCHA contact form on your blog. It requires PHP 5.0 or later.

== Description ==

Contact form with captcha is great plugin for your WordPress blog that enables you to have a contact form 
with the reCAPTCHA challenge system.

All you have to do is install and activate the plugin, enter your reCAPTCHA keys and recipient email address 
in the Admin section (and other optional fields), and place the shortcode `[cfwc]` on any page or post within 
your blog.

The form asks users for their name, email address, subject and message. The plugin will validate email address
before sending the email. Labels can be modified based on your needs or language preferences.

The plugin supports multiple color themes for reCaptcha to meet your site or blog color schemes. It also supports two themes for the form - Parallel and stacked.

Plugin allows webmasters to specify/configure tags or identifiers before and after subject text (E.g: "#### SUBJECT ####")so that you can easily mark/manage your emails based on the identifers.

reCAPTCHA Form can be installed alongside any other plugins that use the reCAPTCHA challenge system, however you must 
make sure that whatever post/page you insert the reCAPTCHA Form shortcode on does not already display a reCAPTCHA
